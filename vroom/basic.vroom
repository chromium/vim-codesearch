First lets open up a file that's inside a fake directory that looks like a
Chromium checkout.

  :e testdata/src/base/base64.cc

In the beginning, we search for 'hello world'. Fortunately there are lots of
instances of this in the Chromium tree.

  :CrSearch hello world
  CodeSearch results for ^q{hello\ world}q_
  &
  *hello_world.js* (glob)
  * (glob)
  *found in the LICENSE file* (glob)

That should be it for a basic test case.
